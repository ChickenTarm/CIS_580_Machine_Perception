# CIS_580_Machine_Perception

To run main.m which will produce the graphs/plots, all you have to do is type "main" in the console in matlab. Currently the folder where the data is hard coded absolute path on my local machine, you will need to change that on line 3 to where the data is located. Also the images: 1 and 2 are read in at lines 40 and 41, those will also need to be changed. Lastly the camera calibration matrix is hardcoded but copied from the intrinsicMatrix.txt file, if you plan to use a different matrix, then replace the one at line 18. Beyond that the code will run normally and the plots will be produced.
